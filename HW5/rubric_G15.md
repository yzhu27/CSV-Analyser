| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate system running on their computer) | 2          | Can't tell, but since all members contributes different files, they possibly can |
| Evidence that the team members are working across multiple places in the code base                                                                  | 3          | Evidence in multiple files that most files have more than one contributor, contributors often show up in different areas.                                                                                            |
